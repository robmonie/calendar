To Do:
* Submit booking
* Confirmation email
* Calendar events added to calendar should also send invitation to the client
* Add cancellation policy

* Should practitioners just login with their google account ?


Design decisions:

* All user experiences should be responsive down to iphone size
* It's all about clients booking directly into a google calendar. No other features matter yet.


Why and who ?

* Assumption that many practitioners use google calendar or just their phone as a way to organise their appointments. The iphone calendar app works so why rewrite it ?
* Assumption that it would be beneficial for practitioners to let their clients book online from their own website.




Ideas for FAQs

* All day events aren't preventing bookings for the day - Make sure to select 'busy' in the calendar event as this is not the default for all day events.


Ideas for Docs

* We don't store any of your calendar event data. This is all stored in google and accessed when we need to check for availability or book appointments into your calendar.
