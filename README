To Do:

* Validate appointment_types
* Change appointment type from a select list to radio buttons with formatting (like opencal)
* Selecting a practitioner is only necessary if there are multiple. Auto-select and display as text if not.
* Enter customer details (email, mobile, name)
* Submit booking
* Confirmation email
* Calendar events added to calendar should also send invitation to the client

* Should practitioners just login with their google account ?


Design decisions:

* All user experiences should be responsive down to iphone size
* It's all about clients booking directly into a google calendar. No other features matter yet.


Why and who ?

* Assumption that many practitioners use google calendar or just their phone as a way to organise their appointments. The iphone calendar app works so why rewrite it ?
* Assumption that it would be beneficial for practitioners to let their clients book online from their own website.
