## To Do:
* Submit booking
* Confirmation email
* Calendar events added to calendar should also send invitation to the client
* Add a cancellation policy

* Should practitioners just login with their google account ?


## Design decisions:

* All user experiences should be responsive down to iphone size
* It's all about clients booking directly into a google calendar. No other features matter yet.


## Why and who ?

* Assumption that many practitioners use google calendar or just their phone as a way to organise their appointments. The iphone calendar app works so why rewrite it ?
* Assumption that it would be beneficial for practitioners to let their clients book online from their own website.



## FAQs

* All day events aren't preventing bookings for the day - Make sure to select 'busy' in the calendar event as this is not the default for all day events.


## Marketing Site

* With Calendar App, your clients can book directly into your Google Calendar from your website or ours.
* Clients choose a time that suits that from a selection of times that are actually available. Clients are notified via email when they book and sent a calendar invitation. They are also reminded once on the day before their appointment.

* You continue to manage your appointments via your Google Calendar, your smart phone or desktop calendar application.

### Privacy info
* We don't store any of your calendar event data. This is all stored in google and accessed when we need to check for availability or book appointments into your calendar.
